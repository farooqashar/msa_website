                MSA maintains a prayer room (Musalla) with daily prayers at <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=W11" target="_blank">Religious Activites Center (W11)</a>, including jumu'ah prayers every Friday. During Ramadan MSA organizes iftaars and suhoors, and holds taraweeh prayers.
                </p>
                <p>
                Musalla is open 7/24 for everyone. You need an MIT ID to get in the building during the night, but other times you can just walk in without an ID.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Jumu'ah (Friday) prayers</strong> are held every week at Musalla (during the academic year and the summer) at <strong>1:25pm</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                In addition to Musalla, there are other rooms on campus dedicated as prayer rooms or meditation spaces.
                They are located in Sloan area: <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=E52" target="_blank">E52-112</a> is a dedicated Muslim prayer room, and <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=E51" target="_blank">E51-050</a> and <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=E52" target="_blank">E52-212</a> are dedicated non-denominational prayer and meditation spaces.
                You should e-mail slquestions@mit.edu to get access to these rooms (please be specific about which rooms you want access to, and include your nine digit MIT ID number).
