                Nada El-Alami has dedicated her time to be at the service of the Muslim community. She has served for over
                15 years in leading study circles. During the last decade, she has planned and supported faith-oriented
                programs, such as classes and retreats. Much of her work has been focused on youth and young adults. She
                has also led educational institutions catering to young Muslims, namely Al Huda Academy in Worcester and
                Malik Academy in Boston. She has a B. A. in psychology and and M.A. in administration and leadership. She
                holds an Ijaza (authenticated certificate with direct one-to-one transmission going back to the Prophet

                <p>
                Nada's spiritual journey started as a teenager. She found great satisfaction in learning to differentiate
                between cultural and religious practices. She strongly believes in the kindness and mercy of God, the power
                of strong brotherly and sisterly bonds, and the need to offer a true glimpse of Islam through dialogue.
                Nada is very passionate about working with Muslim youth, college students and young adults. She is married
                to Hassan El-Alami and has 3 children and 1 granddaughter.
