            The holy month of Ramadan requires fasting, spiritual cleanliness, community, and dedication. It is certainly no time for the MIT Muslim Students Association to slack off. As such, the MITMSA provides several key services during this time.

            <p style="text-align:center; font-size:14px;">To donate by credit card to sponsor a community iftar, please <a href="https://giving.mit.edu/givenow/AddGift.dyn?desig=2721137" target="_blank">go here</a>.<br></p>
            <p>Ramadan 1435 is upon us, and the MIT MSA is working enthusiastically to highlight the splendor of Ramadan for all MIT students in their hectic academic schedules and away from their families. The Holy Month will be starting on June 28.</p>
            <p>For all of Ramadan, the iftars will be in served in the student center (W20), and the ecxact location will be announced on this page. All community iftars are sponsored by generous members who donate to the MIT Muslim community every year, as we cannot receive assistance from the MIT administration for these iftars.</p>
            <p>This endeavor has been made possible year after year through the support of well-wishers like yourself and this year is no different. As each Iftar costs around $650/day, for a total of 30 days, every donation is greatly appreciated.</p>
            <p>You can help via the following methods:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>You can donate by a credit card and the money will be deposited in a special Ramadan account, the money for which is only used for Ramadan purposes and nothing else. To make Credit Card payment, <a href="https://giving.mit.edu/givenow/AddGift.dyn?desig=2721137" target="_blank">go here</a></li>
            <li>Alternately, you can also pay by check or cook for the community (around 80 people) for one day. In the past we have had iftars cooked by Iranian, Bangladeshi, Turkish, and many other cultural groups.</li>
            <li>We will also be collecting donations for these community iftars after Jumu'ah Prayers, as has occurred throughout the summer.</li>
            <li>If you want more information about how your money will be used, or who you can give a check to, or are interested in cooking iftar for us, please do not hesitate to email this year's Ramadan coordinators at msa-ramadan at mit.edu</li>
